# Application Configuration

managed-care-review is [configured using env vars](https://12factor.net/config).

Different env vars can be set in different environments [local dev, review apps, dev, staging, prod] to configure things differently. With our migration to AWS CDK, environment variables are now managed through:

1. **CDK Context**: Stage-specific configuration passed via `--context stage=<env>`
2. **SSM Parameter Store**: Configuration values stored in AWS Systems Manager
3. **Secrets Manager**: Sensitive values like database credentials
4. **Environment Factory**: Centralized TypeScript classes that manage environment variables for Lambda functions

For CDK deployments, new environment variables should be added to the appropriate environment factory in `/services/infra-cdk/lib/constructs/lambda/environment-factory.ts`.

For local dev, we use `.envrc` and `.envrc.local` to set the appropriate environment variables. `.envrc` is loaded first, then `.envrc.local`, so if you need to set anything differently for your local environment you can set it in there. For more details, see the [`direnv` docs](https://direnv.net).

Also, CreateReactApp only loads env vars that start with `VITE_APP_`, so any configuration that needs to be read by app-web must start that way.

## List of Environment Variables

### `VITE_APP_AUTH_MODE`

Read by `app-api` and `app-web` and Cypress.

valid values: `LOCAL`, `AWS_COGNITO`, `IDM`

This tells the application how to perform authentication.

`LOCAL` means to use local auth. Make no requests to cognito, there is custom auth UI in app-web to pick a user. app-web then sends the user as a JSON blob in a header that serverless-offline dumps into the context of our lambda's execution

`AWS_COGNITO` means to use AWS Cognito User Pools for auth. There is UI for creating and logging in with cognito in app-web and app-api can fetch user information from those users using a cognito api as well.

`IDM` means to use CMS IDM as the auth provider. This is what is set in dev/val/prod. Users will be redirected to login in IDM and then redirected back to our site. Cognito will create users in a special Okta user pool and then everything will work the same as if you were auth'd with `AWS_COGNITO` above.

### `VITE_APP_API_URL`

Read by `app-web`

valid values: A URL where app-api is running

This is the base URL that all requests are sent to from app-web

### `VITE_APP_COGNITO_*`

Read by `app-api`

-   VITE_APP_COGNITO_REGION
-   VITE_APP_COGNITO_ID_POOL_ID
-   VITE_APP_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID
-   VITE_APP_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
-   VITE_APP_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_DOMAIN

These four env vars configure cognito auth from the browser. They are ignored if `VITE_APP_AUTH_MODE` is set to `LOCAL` and thus are only set in deployed environments.

### `VITE_APP_APPLICATION_ENDPOINT` / `APPLICATION_ENDPOINT`

Read by app-web and app-api

valid values: A URL where a running app-web can be reached

It's used as the redirects for login by app-web when it configures login via IDM. In CDK deployments, this is automatically imported from the Frontend stack's CloudFront distribution URL.

### `APP_VERSION`

Read by `app-api`

Generated by ./scripts/app_version.sh as part of the build process, this is a short git hash of the running commit, with '-dirty' appended to it if it's not a clean git checkout.

### `OKTA_METADATA_URL`

Read by `ui-auth`

This is the metatdata URL configured for reaching out to Otka auth. Reqired for `IDM` type auth.

### `VITE_APP_STAGE_NAME`

Read by `app-web`

This is used for rudimentary feature flags, allow us to switch things off and on based on deploy environment

### `IAM_PATH`

### `SECRETS_MANAGER_SECRET`

Read by `app-api` to securely pull secrets out of AWS Secrets Manager. Only set in AWS deployed environments, not used locally. This is the name of the secret to pull out of SM, which is scoped by review-app.

### `DATABASE_URL` / `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN`

In CDK deployments, database connections are managed via `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN` which points to an AWS Secrets Manager secret containing the database credentials. The Lambda functions automatically retrieve and use these credentials.

For local development, `DATABASE_URL` is still used and must be set to a valid `postgres://` URL.

### `VITE_APP_S3_*`

Read by `app-web`

-   VITE_APP_S3_DOCUMENTS_BUCKET

The name of the bucket that documents are uploded to as part of the state submission form.

-   VITE_APP_S3_REGION

The region in AWS where the bucket is located. Cannot be set if VITE_APP_S3_LOCAL_URL is set.

-   VITE_APP_S3_LOCAL_URL

The local URL where an s3 server is being run. Cannot be set if VITE_APP_S3_REGION is set.

### `EMAILER_MODE`

Read by `app-api`

Determines which emailer to use, local or AWS SES emailer. Valid values are `LOCAL` or `SES`

### `SES_SOURCE_EMAIL_ADDRESS`

Read by `app-api`

Sets the "from" address for all emails sent by the system. This address must have been added to SES and validated there, in order to work.

### `SES_REVIEW_HELP_EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `SES_RATE_HELP_EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `SES_DEV_TEAM_HELP_EMAIL_ADDRESS`

Read by `app-api`

Single email addresses, used in email bodies to indicate where a state user could go for help with any issues about the submission.

### `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

Read by CI for deploys, add_cypress_test_users.ts, `./dev local web --hybrid`

Configures the secrets necessary to interact with AWS services. Can be generated by CloudTamer for local use.

### `CLOUDFRONT_CERTIFICATE_ARN`, `CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN_NAME`

Read by `app-web`

Used in dev/val/prod to set https certs and host names

### `FULL_IAM_PERMISSIONS_BOUNDARY_POLICY`

Read by `app-api`, `postgres`, `ui-auth`, `uploads`

Much of our infra sits inside this permissions boundary.

### `SLACK_WEBHOOK`

Read by Slack Alert Notifier

This is the webhook URL for sending alerts to our alerts channel

### `TEST_USERS_PASS`

Read by the Create Test Users action and Cypress in AWS_COGNITO mode

This is how we set the test users password configured for all review apps

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`

Read by the create deployment CI task, Cypress

This is an auth token provided by GH in Actions that allows CI to make calls to the GH API.

### `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY`

Read by Cypress in CI

This is the key used by Cypress to send results to Cypress Dashboard.

### `CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID`

Read by codeclimate-action

This key allows uploads to CodeClimate for our code coverage stats.

### `OTEL_COLLECTOR_URL`

Read by Trace Context

This URL defines where we export traces to. It should differ between local dev and deployed environments.

### `LD_SDK_KEY`

Read by `app-api`

This is the key for Launch Darkly SDK access in our backend. There is one per environment of local/dev/val/prod.

### `VITE_APP_LD_CLIENT_ID`

Read by `app-web`

This is the client ID for Launch Darkly in our frontend. This key is designed to have limited access since it's exposed in our client side code. There is one per environment of local/dev/val/prod.

### `VITE_APP_NR_*`

Read by `app-web`

There are vars per environment for dev/val/prod.

-   VITE_APP_NR_ACCOUNT_ID
-   VITE_APP_NR_AGENT_ID

These are the same in all environments.

-   VITE_APP_NR_LICENSE_KEY
-   VITE_APP_NR_TRUST_KEY

These env vars configure new relic for browser monitoring. They are interpolated into browser monitoring inline script. If we move towards integration via New Relic APM instead, these variables can be deleted.

## CDK Configuration Management

With our migration to CDK, configuration is managed through several mechanisms:

### CDK Context Variables
- `stage`: The deployment stage (dev, val, prod)
- Set via command line: `cdk deploy --context stage=dev`
- Accessed in CDK code: `this.node.tryGetContext('stage')`

### Stage Configuration
Centralized in `/services/infra-cdk/lib/config/stage-config.ts`:
- Lambda settings (memory, timeout, architecture)
- VPC configuration
- Security settings
- Monitoring configuration

### Environment Variables for Lambda Functions
Managed by the Environment Factory pattern:
- Base environment (stage, region, common settings)
- Function-specific environment variables
- Cross-stack references via CloudFormation outputs

## Email configuration

Important email configuration is stored in AWS Parameter Store. Reference for the expected values can be found in [Confluence](https://qmacbis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OY2/pages/3164864517/Emails)

We plan to move this to the DB down the road. Until then, know that if these values are not set properly, unexpected errors may occur in deployed applications. We guard against this with the [Parameter Store module](/services/app-api/src/parameterStore/awsParameterStore.ts) and in config checks in [apollo_gql](../services/app-api/src/handlers/apollo_gql.ts).

### Guidelines for usage of Parameter Store for emails

1. Parameter stores across environments will have the same names.
2. Clearly define the purpose of each variable in this file, as well as if it is configured differently by environment or we expect the same values for all environments.
3. Valid values in parameter store are strings and string lists. We prefer string lists to allow additional addresses to be added if needed.
