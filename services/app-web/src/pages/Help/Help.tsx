                    A contract action is contractually compliant if the
                    requirements are explicitly stated in the contract.

                    A contract action is operationally compliant if the
                    associated health plans adhere to the requirement, but the
                    requirement is not stated explicitly in the contract.
                    Operational compliance does not achieve contractual
                    compliance.

                <p className="line-height-sans-4 measure-6">

                    all applicable requirements.” and complete the question that

                    This contract action is not compliant with § 438.71(a), due
                    to the need for legislative approval. We plan to incorporate
                    this new requirement into our contracts effective July 1,
                    2024, and submit the amendment to CMS no later than August
                    1, 2024. We have communicated this new requirement to health
                    plans, informing them that the system must be implemented no
                    later than July 1, 2024.

                    This contract action does not include the requirement at
                    §438.10(c)(6)(ii). The state overlooked this requirement
                    when developing SFY24 contracts. However, we conduct ongoing
                    monitoring of plans’ compliance with all information
                    requirements, and attest to the plans’ operational
                    compliance with §438.10(c)(6)(ii). We will be updating our
                    contracts with this provision, effective July 1, 2024, and
                    will submit the amendment to CMS no later than August 1,
