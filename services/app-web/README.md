# app-web

This service builds our React frontend. It contains all documentation and component tests for the main UI.

Note: Storybook `.stories` and configuration can also be found in this service as well.

## Significant dependencies

Familiarizing yourself with these dependencies will help you navigate the codebase.

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app) - build and configures our React application, see also [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts)
-   [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - declarative routing
-   [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) - state management library for data coming in from graphql
-   [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) - form development and validation
-   [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) - deployed UI component playground
-   [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) - schema validation - used with Formik but can also be used alone
-   [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - schema validation - used when converting to our domain models
-   [Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/) - All our comms from app-web to AWS are mediated by Amplify. It handles cognito auth, s3 uploads, and authenticates our API calls.

## Useful scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm clean`

Clear pnpm cache and reinstall.

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `pnpm test: once`

Launches the test runner and runs through once,running all tests serially in the current process. Used in CI.

### `pnpm test:update`

Override failing snapshot tests and update existing snapshot tests with new markup. Use sparingly - may be a valid failure.

### `pnpm test:coverage`

Generate code coverage.

### `pnpm test:clear`

Clears jest cache, this can resolve false negatives in unit tests.

## `pnpm storybook`

Run storybook.
Open [http://localhost:6000](http://localhost:6000) to view in the browser.

## Organization

### TSX files

-   **`src/index.tsx`** main React application entrypoint - configures authentication, api, s3. Further configuration can be found in `src/pages/App`/
-   `src/pages` folder is used for components and logic specific to a page (content that is inside `<main>`).
-   `src/components` folder is used abstracted, reuseable components. These are components without significant routing or page-specific logic. Often these components work well in storybook.
-   Use nested folders named after the component. Tests are stored alongside components.
-   List file imports in this order: React imports, external imports, assets/styles imports, local imports. [needs automation]

### SCSS files

-   Use modular styles. This means creating`<component>.module.scss` or `<component>.module.css` files in your component folders.
-   Read [how to styles](/docs/technical-design/howto-style-css-scss.md) documentation.

### `/gen`

This folder is auto-generated by the [`app-graphql`](../app-graphql) service.

## Tests

### Jest and [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/)

-   We write unit and react component integration tests with these tools. For more, learn about `testing-library` [queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about) and [`waitFor`](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async) as well as [`jest-dom` matchers](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom). Understanding these will make it much easier to write React tests.
-   If all seems lost try - `console.info(prettyDOM(firstItem))` - to print the test html with attributes
-   Snapshot tests, written with [`react-test-renderer`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-test-renderer) can be useful to guard against small regressions from unintended changes to markup. However, they should be used sparingly, since we have many other great testing tools in place. If a snapshot test fails, make sure the failure is expected and not a UI bug before updating the snapshot.
